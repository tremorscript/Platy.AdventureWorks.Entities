# Overview

This library contains the entity classes related to the tables/columns in the AdventureWorks2022 database.

The classes were generated using the [EntityFrameworkCore.Generator](https://www.nuget.org/packages/EntityFrameworkCore.Generator/) tool.

The `entity-generation.yml` file was used as input. This helps in generating entity classes for any database quickly.
